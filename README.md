# Testing Practice

This repository contains my solution for the **Testing Practice** project from The Odin Project’s **JavaScript course**.

In this project, I wrote functions and corresponding tests to practice using Jest for unit testing.

## 🧪 Features
- Basic function testing (`sum`, `capitalize`, `reverse`)
- Calculator object with arithmetic operations
- Caesar Cipher with wrap-around, case preservation, and negative shifts
- Array analysis function returning average, min, max, and length
- Jest tests covering normal, edge, and mixed cases

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm test
